                    <h3> Project Description </h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Script allows user to choose an NYC borough, as well as a year from 1940-2040, with the system returning the
                    number of people living in that borough in that year. </p>
                </div>


            </div>

            <p>In this project, we explored APIs by interacting with the objects from the dataset.
            In my case, I grabbed an API that stored the number of people in each borough through a time frame.
            The data had population in each borough through the years 1950-2040.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now, I'm going to go through some of the struggles and next steps I have with this project.
            The challenges I had with this project was visualizing how the object's worked.  To simply put it,
            I had trouble with grabbing the data in the script.js file, because the naming system was slightly different.
            I realized that the property names were abnormal in the sense that it had spaces in front of it, and
            sometimes there were inconsistent underscores. I was able to fix it by manually writing out the names with my
            knowledge of concantenating strings. I then stored it as a variable which then can be used in bracket
            notation to grab the value. (Look at the image below for reference)</p>
            <br>
            <p>In terms of doing anything different, I would strive to go for a dataset with more values to
            work with. However, since this was my first time making a projecxt with APIs, it was a good start.
            I would definitely go for something that contain more information next time, and possibly
            do some manipulation with the data. With this project, I really only displayed the data in a nice
            sentence. I hadn't done any manipulation with the data. Those are my next steps with working with
            APIs.</p>
